                        Killing zombies also gives points to buy power ups, which will be especially important at higher dfficulties. For added difficulty players have to naviagte the map without fallinf off, or they will face a gruesome toxic waste death!</p>

I had never even heard of the Gini Index before this assignment, but is an exmple of how Computer Science can teach you both about programming and the real world.  
                                The program was the other half of my AP Final grade and was way more challengin to mkae than Pong, but all that meant was it was even more rewarding when it was finished and I could run it for the first time.</p>
