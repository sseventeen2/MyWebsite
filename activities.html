                        events designed to engage members of the community inluding trunk or treat and the RV show.</p>

                       <p>I joined my junior year after a friend told me about it and I am really glad I did. I had never done fencing before and so was
                        very nervous to do it especially as my first High School sport. While I found it challenging I always tried my best to learn from my experiences and have gotten better with more practice
                        As senior I won my first match and it felt really rewarding, hopefully more to come.  Overall its been a positvie and enjoable expereicne so I am happy I put myself outside of my comfort zone by joining.</p>

                      <h3>IT Internship</h3>
                       <p>The summer of junior year I began my first internship working with the IT team for the South Orangetown Central School Distract.  The job taught me a lot and required travelling to all 4 schools in order to complete various jobs and prep the schools for reoppening.  
                        These tasks included rtetiring devices, enrolling new devices, cabling, setting up smart boards, dismantling chromebooks for extra parts, and checking setup and functional state of the devices in classrooms. I found out about the internship from my 
                        Computer Science teacher Mrs. Connell and I am really grateful she told me about this itnership ebcause it was a great oppurtunity to obtain technical and real world skills in a safe environment.</p>

                       <p>I started volunteering at religion in 7th grade with my sister before covid. After covid, I wasn't able to start volunteering again until 10th grade. I became the hall monitor for an hour and a half every every Wednesday. 
                        In addition to my hall monitor duties I also helped with other tasks in the office, subbing, early pick ups, watched the main building and mange phones while main prep are at church, parking lot drop-off and pick-up, and changing out the books in the library.  <p>
